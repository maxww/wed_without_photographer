# wed_without_photographer
Planning a wedding and struggling with the expense.
This is an idea to save money on wedding photographer:
- Don't hire wedding photographer
- Ask guests to upload pictures they took at the wedding to the Firebase storage
- It's a web app so either iPhones or Android phoens (or Windows phone?) can use this app
- Protentially will save me at least $4000
